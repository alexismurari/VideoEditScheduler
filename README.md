## ðŸ–¥ Introduction
Record your clip and this app will take care of the rest. The objective of this project is to edit and auto schedule your favorite clips on your social media (YouTube, Facebook and Twitter).

I created this project mainly to play around with the different APIs Google, Twitter and Meta offer and try at the same time to create a fun and useful tool.

## ðŸ“š Useful documentation and libraries used
- YouTube API (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/uploading_a_video)
- MoviePy - for video editing (https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/)
